<h1 align="center">Weather Vue.js 3 Application</h1>

Full-Stack Web Application showing the temperature in a location based on user input and meteorological data, provided by Weather API

Technology stack:
- Vue.js + Vite + Vue-Router (Front-End)
- Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB (Back-end)

For this project, my choice of technology framework was Vue.js due to its lightweight output and state managements functionality between different components

In the future I'm planning to add hour by hour forecast and integration of more sophisticated API
